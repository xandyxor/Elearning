    while SVG will take priority, Jupyter will still typically call the png

    tk. On OS X, this leads to a blank, windowless app in the dock as long as
    the kernel is running. On a headless setup, it leads to errors. This
    convenience function completely disables the png-drawing code in nltk. If it
    fails (either because nltk isn't installed, or the relevant function has
    already been deleted) it will fail silently.
